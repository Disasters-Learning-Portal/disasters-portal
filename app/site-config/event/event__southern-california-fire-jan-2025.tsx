        "Beginning Jan. 7, 2025, several major wildfires swept through Los Angeles County, driven by powerful Santa Ana winds. The Palisades Fire, Eaton Fire, and Hurst Fire caused widespread destruction across communities from Pacific Palisades to Pasadena and San Fernando, resulting in significant loss of life, property damage, and power outages. The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (CalOES), the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management, and FEMA Region 9 requested NASA's support to address several critical situational awareness needs – including identifying burned structures and damaged critical infrastructure, assessing fire extent, monitoring air quality and methane emissions, and tracking power outages across affected communities.",
        <Fragment key="2">
          The NASA Disasters Program participated coordination calls hosted by CalOES and FEMA to
          align with responder priorities. Mapping the scope of destruction was an early focus –
          NASA shared multispectral imagery, including Sentinel-2, Landsat, and Maxar analysis, to
          characterize burned areas and potential structural losses, while Synthetic Aperture Radar
          (SAR){" "}

          nighttime lights near real-time data gave local, state and federal partners a running
          picture of which communities had likely lost power and how electrical grid restoration
          progressed across the region. Where smoke and emissions posed possible risks to public
          health, <Link href="https://tempo.si.edu/">TEMPO</Link> satellite data characterized air
          quality and assessed adverse health conditions. To assess potential risks of hazardous
          materials on the ground, NASA deployed{" "}
