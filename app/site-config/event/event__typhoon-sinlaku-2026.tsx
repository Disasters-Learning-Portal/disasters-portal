          In coordination with FEMA and other federal partners, the NASA Disasters Program worked
          with FEMA, USGS, the American Red Cross and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
          to support the U.S. response to the storm. The program shared satellite-based maps and
          data with partners, including NASA Black Marble data to assess power outages, landslide
          hazard assessment maps, and imagery from commercial partners – enabled by NASA&apos;s{" "}

          – that provided context and situational awareness. NASA also shared IMERG satellite
          precipitation data to assess rainfall impacts when ground-based weather radars on the
          islands were disabled by the storm.
