        `The NASA Disasters Program puts Earth science to work for those who make critical
          decisions before, during, and after disasters. We translate NASA's unmatched view of Earth
          from space into actionable insights, helping emergency managers, government agencies, and
          industry partners prepare for high-impact hazards, respond effectively when disasters
          strike, and recover more fully in their aftermath. From hurricanes and volcanoes to floods
          and earthquakes, we use NASA's data, tools, and expertise to build resilience in
          communities across the U.S. and around the world.`,
