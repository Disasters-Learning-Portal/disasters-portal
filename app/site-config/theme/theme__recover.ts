It does not represent actual buildings in the grid cell. The left image is the total built up area which aggregates all construction types, durability types, and height categories per grid cell. The right image shows the amount of low-rise (1-3 story), wood-framed structures per grid cell. Each 100x100 meter grid cell represents the total area in square meters.",
