        "When catastrophic flash flooding struck Texas Hill Country on July 4, 2025, emergency managers faced an urgent challenge: a fast-moving disaster, and a near-total lack of imagery to identify the people and places most impacted. Persistent cloud cover blocked optical satellites. Commercial radar assets struggled to see through the region's dense tree canopy. In the critical early days of search and rescue, the people making life-and-death decisions had almost no imagery of the hardest-hit areas.",

        "The NASA Disasters Program moved quickly to fill that gap. Working directly with FEMA and the Texas Division of Emergency Management, the program coordinated specialized aircraft deployments to rapidly deliver flood maps and high-resolution imagery that helped guide search and rescue efforts and resource deployment.",

          WB-57 captured detail sharp enough to identify individual structures, debris fields, and

          directly to responders as the flights were still in the air, providing coverage of the San

          NASA’s <Link href="https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/">UAVSAR</Link> instrument tackled a
          different challenge: the region's dense tree canopy. UAVSAR uses L-band radar – a longer
          wavelength than most satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems – which can pass
          through vegetation to detect water pooled beneath the trees. While conventional radar sees
          only treetops, UAVSAR returned a signal from the forest floor, revealing inundation that
          would otherwise go unmeasured. Flying aboard a Gulfstream III out of NASA's Armstrong
          Flight Research Center, the instrument covered the Guadalupe, San Gabriel, and Colorado
          River basins across three days of flights, providing the first publicly available observed
          flood maps of the disaster.

          synthetic aperture radar satellite that began delivering data in early 2026. What UAVSAR
