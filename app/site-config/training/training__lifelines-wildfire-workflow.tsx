        "Wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity across the globe, threatening communities, critical infrastructure, and ecosystems with little warning. Timely, data-driven information is essential for responders and decision-makers to protect lives and coordinate action before and during a wildfire.",
        "This training module introduces a near real-time approach to wildfire early warning built on freely available NASA satellite data. Using active fire detections from the NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), the module walks users through identifying fire locations, delineating risk zones, and assessing exposure of populations and infrastructure — all within a guided, interactive environment requiring no software installation.",
